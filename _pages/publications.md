REU Summer 2023
---
Participated in an [REU](https://sites.northwestern.edu/dynamicsrtg/about/) at Northwestern University studying dynamical systems. Our project was "Anosov actions on the 3-torus and other nilmanifolds by surface groups", which combined flavors from differential geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and group theory. We were able to find such a construction and also begun to explore several directions. This [report](../files/Report_LeonardLouieShinTung.pdf) give some expository background and proves our result.
