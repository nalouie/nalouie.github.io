REU Summer 2023
---
Participated in an [REU](https://sites.northwestern.edu/dynamicsrtg/about/) at Northwestern University studying dynamical systems, mentored by Professor Aaron Brown. Our project was "Anosov actions on the 3-torus and other nilmanifolds by surface groups", which combined flavors from differential geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and group theory. We were able to find such a construction and also begun to explore several directions. This [report](../files/Report_LeonardLouieShinTung.pdf) give some expository background and proves our result. 


WXML Autumn 2023
---
Particpating in a Washington eXperimental Mathematics Lab ([WXML](https://wxml.math.washington.edu/)), guided by Professor Jarod Alper. Our project is on the formalization of mathematics using Lean. See [here](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~jarod/xll.html) for the website with more description.
