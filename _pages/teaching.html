<h2>UT Directed Reading</h2>

From 2024 to present, I have participating as a graduate student mentor to undergraduate students in the Directed Reading Program at UT. This program is designed to give undergraduate students an opportunity to learn about a topic of their choice in mathematics that is not typically covered in the undergraduate curriculum. I have mentored students particularly in topology. 

<h2>UW Algebra Mentoring</h2>


From 2023 to 2024, I mentored for abstract algebra reading groups for undergraduate students to prepare them for the graduate algebra sequence at UW. We covered a typical course on group theory, ring theory, and field theory during these two quarters from ``Abstract Algebra'' by Dummit and Foote. This included exercises and presentations.
